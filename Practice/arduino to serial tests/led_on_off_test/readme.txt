Simple trial of turning the LED pin of the arduino on and off based on the number that the user enters. 1 = on, 0 = off.
Direct connection between computer and Arduino Uno via USB cable
Run this in terminal with command: python led_on_off.py

Note: change the port field of the serial object in the python file to the correct USB port that the arduino is connected to on your computer. 
You can find out which port this is by going to Tools >> Port in the arduino sketch.
